## 🎯 File Organization Logic

### Root = Essential
Only files you need regularly:
- Documentation (README, QUICK_START, DEPLOYMENT)
- Scripts (start-all.bat, start-backend.bat, start-frontend.bat)
- Config (package.json, .gitignore)

### docs/ = Reference
Files you need occasionally:
- Technical documentation
- Feature explanations
- Bug fix history
- Development notes

### backend/ = Backend Code
Python FastAPI application

### frontend/ = Frontend Code
React + Vite application

---

## 📊 Before vs After

### Before Cleanup
```
Root Directory:
- 30+ files
- Mix of docs, scripts, configs
- Hard to find what you need
- Looks messy
```

### After Cleanup
```
Root Directory:
- 8 essential files
- Clear purpose for each
- Easy to navigate
- Professional appearance
```
