# Real-Time Analysis Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Questions Not Changing
**Problem**: Same question showing repeatedly when clicking "Next"

**Root Cause**: Wrong Gemini model name
- Used: `gemini-pro` (not available in current API)
- Error: `404 models/gemini-pro is not found`
- Fallback was always returning the same default question

**Solution**:
- Updated to `gemini-2.0-flash` (stable, available model)
- Upgraded `google-generativeai` library to latest version
- Verified model availability with API

**Result**: ‚úÖ Each question is now unique and different

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Session Stats Not Updating
**Problem**: Questions: 0, Filler Words: 0, Speech Pace: 0 WPM

**Root Cause**: Questions counter only updated after audio transcription completed

**Solution**:
- Increment `questionsAnswered` immediately when recording stops
- Add fallback to increment even if transcription fails
- Enhanced filler word detection (added: so, basically, actually)
- Better logging for debugging

**Result**: ‚úÖ Session stats now update in real-time

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Real-Time Metrics Working
**Current Status**:
- ‚úÖ Eye Contact: 74% (working)
- ‚úÖ Posture: 64% (working)
- ‚úÖ Gestures: 100% (working)
- ‚úÖ Overall Confidence: 73% (working)
- ‚úÖ Frame analysis every 3 seconds
- ‚úÖ First frame analyzed after 1 second

## Changes Made

### Backend Files

#### 1. `backend/services/gemini_service.py`
```python
# Changed model name
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash')  # Was: 'gemini-pro'
```

#### 2. `backend/requirements.txt`
```
google-generativeai  # Updated to latest version (0.8.5)
```

### Frontend Files

#### 1. `frontend/src/pages/InterviewDashboard.jsx`

**Question Loading - Added Logging**:
```javascript
const loadNextQuestion = async () => {
  console.log('Loading next question. Previous questions:', previousQuestions.length);
  const response = await apiService.generateQuestion('General', 'medium', previousQuestions);
  console.log('New question received:', response);
  // ... rest of code
};
```

**Recording Processing - Immediate Update**:
```javascript
const processRecording = async (audioBlob) => {
  // Increment questions answered immediately
  setQuestionsAnswered(prev => prev + 1);
  
  // Enhanced filler word detection
  const fillerWordMatches = transcription.text.match(
    /\b(um|uh|like|you know|so|basically|actually)\b/gi
  ) || [];
  
  // Better logging
  console.log('Filler words detected:', fillerWordCount, fillerWordMatches);
};
```
