# 🔄 Session Ending Modal - Enhancement

## Problem
When clicking "End Session", the user was immediately redirected to the report page without any feedback, making it seem like nothing was happening during report generation.

## Solution
Added a beautiful loading modal that shows while the session is ending and the report is being generated.

---

## ✨ Features Added

### 1. **Loading State**
```javascript
const [isEndingSession, setIsEndingSession] = useState(false);
```

### 2. **Modal Trigger**
When user clicks "End Session":
- `setIsEndingSession(true)` - Shows modal
- Processes session data
- Generates report
- Navigates to report page
- Modal auto-closes on navigation

### 3. **Error Handling**
If report generation fails:
- `setIsEndingSession(false)` - Hides modal
- Shows error alert
- User stays on interview page
